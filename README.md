# Data Visualization in Tableau - US Census Demographic Data


## <b>Introduction</b><br>

In this project I am exploring a US Census Demographic data set, and visualizing some findings using Tableau.


## <b>About the Data Set</b>

The data comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muonneutrino/us-census-demographic-data), and it includes the census data for all US counties in 2015. The data originates from the DP03 and DP05 tables of the 2015 American Community Survey 5-year estimates, while the Census Bureau updates the estimates approximately every year. 

For this project, I am using the data file _acs2015countydata.csv_, which provides data for each US county, including DC and Puerto Rico.
For the full data sets and more information, please refer to the [United States Cencus Bureau website](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/).

## Summary

In this visualization, we can see all the ethnicities for which there is data for in the provided data set, i.e. **Asian**, **Black**, **Hispanic**, **Native**, and **White**, in alphabetical order.

We can see is that the more evenly distributed ethnicities are the White & Asian populations. To further explain, by even distribution, I mean that these two ethinicities appear in many states 


## Design

I chose this bar chart as the most appropriate, in my opinion, for illustrating the above finding. It is a simple but effective choice that reveals something that may not be so intuitive to understand otherwise.

I added two filters, to facilitate the filtering based on state & county, if the reader wants to get the appropriate info in a more in depth level. I have also added data labels following the Min/Max option, so that it is easy to see the highest and lowest value for each ethinicity.

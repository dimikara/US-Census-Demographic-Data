# Data Visualization in Tableau - US Census Demographic Data


## <b>Introduction</b><br>

In this project I am exploring a US Census Demographic data set, and visualizing some findings using Tableau.


## <b>About the Data Set</b>

The data comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muonneutrino/us-census-demographic-data), and it includes the census data for all US counties in 2015. The data originates from the DP03 and DP05 tables of the 2015 American Community Survey 5-year estimates, while the Census Bureau updates the estimates approximately every year. 

For this project, I am using the data file _acs2015countydata.csv_, which provides data for each US county, including DC and Puerto Rico.
For the full data sets and more information, please refer to the [United States Cencus Bureau website](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/).
